# KANBAN BOARD React + TypeScript App

## Definition

Kanban board app allows creating new tasks and organizing them into lists. The app have a bunch of columns that you can drag around. 

Each column represents a list of tasks. 

Each task is rendered as a draggable card. You can drag each card inside the column and between them.

You can create new columns by clicking the button that says '+ Add new list'. Each column has a button at the bottom that allows creating new cards.



The state management is added by using useReducer hook and the React Context API.

React-dnd and react-dnd-html5-backend libraries are using for drag and drop functions.
